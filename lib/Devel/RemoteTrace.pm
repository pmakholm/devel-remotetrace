=head1 NAME

Devel::RemoteTrace - Attachable call trace of perl scripts

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  $ perl -d:RemoteTrace your-script

or

  $ perl -d:RemoteTrace=:trace your-script

or

  use Devel::RemoteTrace;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module implements a perl debugger that sends a call trace of the debugged
perl script to a remote destination via UDP. The default is to send to
localhost:9999.

By using UDP the debug process doesn't have to care aboput if any body is
listening. It just sends the trace messages.

Tracing is enabled and disabled bysending the traced process ans SIGUSR2. If 
the module is called with ':trace' as argument tracing is enabled from the
beginning

=head1 ENVIRONMENT

RemoteTrace uses the followin environment variables:

=over 4

=item DEBUG_ADDR

=item DEBUG_PORT

The hostname and port to send the call trace to.

=back

=head1 BUGS, FEATURES, AND OTHER ISSUES

Using this on untrusted networks might leak security related information

Due to the nature of UDP there is no guarantee that the receiver gets all
function calls. This could be "fixed" by adding a sequence number.
